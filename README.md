I am tasked with predicting if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

Therefore if I can accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, I can determine the cost of a launch. With the help of my Data Science findings and models, the competing startup I have been hired by can make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
